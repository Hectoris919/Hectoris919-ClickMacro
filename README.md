### This is a repository for a little tool I made called clickmacro - a macro library built with the AutoHotKey programming language

These macros were made with Minecraft gameplay in mind.


The macros included in this program:

* A macro to spam the ***left mouse button*** whenever it is pressed with the ***Alt*** key held down
* A macro to spam the ***right mouse button*** whenever it is pressed with the ***Alt*** key held down
* A macro to spam the ***space bar*** whenever ***X*** is held down
* A macro that spams the ***right mouse button*** a user-defined amount when ***Alt*** and ***V*** are pressed at the same time
* A macro that presses the ***left mouse button*** and then ***right mouse button*** in quick succession when ***Alt*** and ***R*** are pressed at the same time
