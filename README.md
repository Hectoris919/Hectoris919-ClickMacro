# Hectoris919's Clickmacro Repository

This is a repository for a little tool I made called clickmacro - a macro library built with the AutoHotKey programming language
These macros were made with Minecraft gameplay in mind.


The macros included in this program:

* A macro to spam the ***left mouse button*** whenever it is pressed with the ***Alt*** key held down
* A macro to spam the ***right mouse button*** whenever it is pressed with the ***Alt*** key held down
* A macro to spam the ***space bar*** whenever ***X*** is held down
* A macro that spams the ***right mouse button*** a user-defined amount when ***Alt*** and ***V*** are pressed at the same time
* A macro that presses the ***left mouse button*** and then ***right mouse button*** in quick succession when ***Alt*** and ***R*** are pressed at the same time



### ***Download clickmacro.exe if you want a copy that works without having to download and install AutoHotHey. Download clickmacro.ahk if you want to compile the program yourself.***

If you wish to compile the program yourself, or want to create your own macros, you can download AutoHotKey at: https://www.autohotkey.com/

### Known issues regarding the program and its macros:

AutoHotKey is not a multitasking programming language, so pressing additional keys while using a macro will cause the macro to be terminated.
This means that if you are pressing the WASD keys frequently, you must re-trigger the macros to make them work again.

If AutoHotkey resolves this issue in the future, I will change my program accordingly and upload it as a new version
